====================
Water Tracker is a simple Android app, that allows you to track the number of glasses that you drink a day (up to a 
healthy ideal of 9 glasses), and reminds you throughout the day to keep drinking water (though it has been suggested to me
the alternative beverages might be fun too).

The code tracks and visualizes your water consumption over the last 9 days.
